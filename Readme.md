Space Shoot
-----------

A space invaders implementation in love2d. I wrote this tiny game for fun while playing
with the love2d framework, so the code isn't optimal nor tidy.

To play it you need the love2d 0.9.0 installed. Get it here: https://love2d.org/

See that if you have trouble with it: https://www.love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started

The original images used were found in http://openclipart.org/

Use the startgame.sh script to easily pack and run the game if you make any changes in Linux.
You have to run it from the game's root directory. Note that it will include
unnecessary files in your .love file so pack it manually if you want to distribute
a derivative.

About the game
--------------

Use the left and right arrows to move the spaceship. Use the space bar to
shoot. There are 3 levels. The max score that can be achieved is 10500.

Destroying enemy ship earns 50 points. There are 3 * 40 = 120 enemy ships total.
Each life when completing a level earns 500 points.
Every lost shot deducts 5 points.

Good luck and have fun!
